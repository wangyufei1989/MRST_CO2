function [flt, keep] = removeFaultBdryFaces(flt, G)
%Remove fault faces on boundary
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%    flt       = removeFaultBdryFaces(flt, G)
%   [flt, msk] = removeFaultBdryFaces(flt, G)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   flt - A fault structure as defined by function 'processFaults'.
%
%   G   - A grid structure representing a discretised reservoir geometry.
%
% RETURNS:
%   flt - An updated fault structure.  Faults that no longer have any
%         constituent faces from the grid are removed.
%
%   msk - Logical mask into original 'flt' that indicates whether or not
%         the corresponding fault structure was still active after removing
%         its boundary faces.  Specifically, msk(i)==TRUE if fault 'i'
%         still has active faces after removing boundary contributions.
%         Moreover, its position in the updated 'flt' structure is pos(i)
%         where pos=CUMSUM(DOUBLE(msk)).
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   processFaults.
