function [fnodes, nnodes, neigh, tags] = copyFaces(G, f)
%Copy face data for faces F from grid structure
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [fnodes, nnodes, neigh, tags] = copyFaces(G, f)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G       - Grid structure as described by grid_structure.
%
%   f       - Face number to be copied.
%
% RETURNS:
%   fnodes  - face nodes
%   nnodes  - number of nodes for each face
%   neigh   - cell neighbors of each face
%   tags    - cellFaces tags for each half-face associated with face.
