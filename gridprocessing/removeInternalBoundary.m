function [G, f] = removeInternalBoundary(G, N)
%Remove internal boundary in grid by merging faces in face list N
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   G = removeInternalBoundary(G, N)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G       - Grid structure as described by grid_structure.
%
%   N       - An n x 2 array of face numbers.  Each pair in the array
%             will be merged to a single face in G.  The connectivity if
%             the new grid is updated accordingly.  The geometric adjacency
%             of faces is not checked.
%
% RETURNS:
%   G       - Modified grid structure.
%
%   f       - New face numbers for the faces that have been merged.
%
%
% COMMENTS:
%
%  What if nodes in f1 are permuted compared to nodes in f2, either due to
%  sign of face (2D) or due to arbitary starting node (3D)?  For the time
%  being, this code assumes that nodes that appear in faces that are being
%  merged coincide exactly --- no checking is doen on node positions.  If
%  nodes are permuted in one of the faces, the resulting grid will be
%  warped.
