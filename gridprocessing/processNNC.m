function nnc = processNNC(G, NNC, varargin)
%Establish explicit non-neighbouring connections from NNC keyword
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   nnc = processNNC(G, NNC)
%   nnc = processNNC(G, NNC, excludeExisting)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G   - MRST grid as defined by 'grid_structure'.
%
%   NNC - Explicit list of non-neighbouring (according to Cartesian cell
%         indices) as defined by function 'readEclipseDeck' from ECLIPSE
%         keyword 'NNC'.  Must be an m-by-7 array in which the first six
%         columns are (I,J,K) Cartesian indices of the first and second
%         connecting cells, respectively, and the seventh column is the
%         transmissibility of the corresponding connection.
%
%   excludeExisiting -
%         Flag indicating whether or not check if any of the explicit
%         non-neighbouring (tentatively non-geometrical) connections (pairs
%         of cells) are already present in the interface list and, if so,
%         exclude those from the new connections.
%
% RETURNS:
%   nnc - Structure describing explicit, additional non-neighbouring
%         connections.  Contains the following fields.
%
%           - cells -- Active cells connected across an NNC.  An m-by-2
%                      array of active cell numbers in the format of
%                      G.faces.neighbors.  Each row of nnc.cells represents
%                      a single non-neighbouring connection.
%
%           - trans -- Transmissibility of the corresponding connections.
%
% NOTE:
%   Option excludeExisting=TRUE is implemented in terms of function
%   ISMEMBER(...,'rows') which uses function SORTROWS.  This is potentially
%   very costly.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   readEclipseDeck, ismember, sortrows.
