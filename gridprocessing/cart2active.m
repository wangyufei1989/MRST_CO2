function activeCells = cart2active(G, cartCells)
%Compute active cell numbers from linear Cartesian index.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   activeCells = cart2active(G, c)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G - Grid data structure as described by 'grid_structure'.
%   c - List of linear Cartesian cell indices.
%
% RETURNS:
%   activeCells - Active cell numbers corresponding to the individual
%                 Cartesian cell numbers in 'c'.
%
% NOTE:
%   This function provides the inverse mapping of the 'G.cells.indexMap'
%   field in the grid data structure.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   grid_structure.
