function G = removeIntGrid(G)
%Cast any grid fields that are presently int32 to double
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   G = removeIntGrid(G);
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G - Grid with fields that are possibly int32.
%
% RETURNS:
%   G - Grid where int32 has been removed from cells/faces subfields
%
% NOTE:
%   Previously int32 was used in the grid structure to conserve memory.
%   This routine converts grids of the old type to the new one.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   grid_structure
