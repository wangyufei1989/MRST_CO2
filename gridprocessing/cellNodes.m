function s = cellNodes(g)
%Extract local-to-global vertex numbering for grid cells.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   cn = cellNodes(G)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G - Grid data structure geometrically discretising a reservoir model.
%
% RETURNS:
%   cn - An m-by-3 array mapping cell numbers to vertex numbers.
%        Specifically, if cn(i,1)==j and cn(i,3)==k, then global vertex 'k'
%        is one of the corners of cell 'j'.  The local vertex number of
%        global node 'k' within cell 'j' may be computed using the
%        statements
%
%           n_vert = accumarray(cn(:,1), 1, [G.cells.num, 1]);
%           offset = rldecode(cumsum([0; n_vert(1:end-1)]), n_vert);
%           loc_no = (1 : size(cn,1)).' - offset;
%
%        This calculation is only for illustration purposes.  It is assumed
%        that the local vertex number will be implicitly available in most
%        applications (e.g., finite element methods).
%
%        Alternatively, the local vertex number is found in cn(i,2). ;). In
%        a cornerpoint grid, local vertex number of zero indicates that the
%        vertex is not part of the original 8 vertices.
