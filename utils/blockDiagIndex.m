function varargout = blockDiagIndex(m, n)
%Compute subscript or linear index to nonzeros of block-diagonal matrix
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [i, j] = blockDiagIndex(m, n)
%   [i, j] = blockDiagIndex(m)
%    i     = blockDiagIndex(...)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   m, n   - Vectors of dimensions/block sizes of each diagonal block.
%            Input 'm' is interpreted as the row dimension of each block
%            while 'n' is interpreted as the column dimension of each
%            block.
%
%            Vector 'n' must have the same number of entries as vector 'm',
%            i.e., the number of blocks.
%
%            If 'n' is not supplied, function 'blockDiagIndex' will behave
%            as if it were called as
%
%                [i, j] = blockDiagIndex(m, m)
%
%            In other words, using square blocks.
%
% RETURNS:
%   i, j   - Index vectors that may be used to form sparse block-diagonal
%            matrix.  This process is demonstrated in the example below.
%
%            The return values are of type DOUBLE irrespective of the class
%            of the dimension vectors 'm' and 'n'.
%
%            If called using a single output value, that value is the
%            linear index, computed using SUB2IND, of the index pair (i,j).
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   m      = [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ];
%   n      = [ 2 ; 3 ; 4 ];
%   [i, j] = blockDiagIndex(m, n);
%   A      = sparse(i, j, 1 : sum(m .* n));
%   full(A), spy(A)
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   rldecode, mcolon, sub2ind.
