function s = simpleEquilibrium(G, contacts, vector)
%Routine for creating simple initial equilibriums
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   s = simpleEquilibrium(G, contacts)
%   s = simpleEquilibrium(G, contacts, vector)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This routine generates cell-wise values that are distributed according
%   to a list of different contacts. The most common usage of this routine
%   is to create initial saturations where the problem is at hydrostatic
%   equilibrium, i.e. the initial phases are distributed according to
%   density.
%
%   As the underlying algorithm makes certain simplifications without
%   taking fluid physics into account, it should be used with care and only
%   for problems with relatively structured grids and no capillary
%   pressure.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   G        - The grid structure for which the properties are to be
%            calculated. Note that we require the grid to have geometry
%            information computed by a call to computeGeometry before usage.
%
%   contacts - A list of up to N contacts. Each contact represents the
%            interface between two properties and N contacts must be given
%            for N + 1 properties. Each contact is given as the distance
%            along the vector (third argument) where the contact occurs. If
%            no third argument is given, the contacts will be assumed to be
%            along the z-coordinate, which is also the default gravity
%            direction in MRST.
%
%   vector   - Optional argument. Two modes are supported:
%            If given as a vector, this vector will be the direction that
%            the contacts are parametrized along. For instance, the default
%            [0, 0, 1] interprets the contacts along the z-direction of the
%            grid. If [1, 0, 1] is given, contacts are interpreted along
%            the 45 degree angle between the x and z axes.
% 
%            If a single value is given, it is interpreted as a index into
%            the cell centroids, i.e. vector = 2 will use the second column
%            of the cell coordinates.
%
%
% RETURNS:
%   s       - A G.cell.num x (N + 1) matrix of properties, distributed
%           according to the contacts. It will not necessarily be
%           guaranteed to be the true equilibrium of the grid is not
%           Cartesian or the fluids physics include capillary forces.
%
% EXAMPLE:
% G = cartGrid([10, 1, 10], [1, 1, 1]);
% G = computeGeometry(G);
% 
% % First contact at .37, second at .8 for a total of three phases present
% contacts = [.37, .8];
% 
% % Compute equilibrium saturations
% s = simpleEquilibrium(G, contacts);
