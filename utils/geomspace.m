function x = geomspace(a, b, n, x0)
%Geometrically spaced vector.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   x = geomspace(x1, x2, n, L0)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   x1, x2 - Lower and upper bounds on resulting vector.
%
%   n      - Number of points to generate between x1 and x2, inclusive.
%            Must be at least two (n >= 2).
%
%   L0     - Length of first (and shortest) sub-interval.
%            Must not exceed (x2 - x1) / (n - 1).
%
% RETURNS:
%   x - n-point row vector from x1 to x2 constructed such that the length
%       of consecutive sub-intervals (i.e., DIFF(x)) *increases* by a
%       constant (geometric) factor.
%
% CAVEATS:
%   This function is based on solving a polynomial equation of degree n-1
%   (using the ROOTS function).  This is an unstable process and,
%   consequently, 'n' should not be too big (usually no greater than 100).
%
%   Due to round-off errors, x(end) may differ slightly from x2.
%
%   These facts mean that geomspace is not a general utility and its use
%   should be carefully considered in every instance.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   linspace, logspace, roots.
