function V = volumeByGaussGreens(G)
%Compute cell volume by means of Gauss-Greens' formula
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   V = volumeByGaussGreens(G)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G - Grid structure.
%
% RETURNS:
%   V - G.cells.num-by-1 array of cell volumes computed by means of
%       Gauss-Greens formula.  This is a useful consistency check when
%       developing new grid processing tools.  In most cases, this value
%       should not deviate too much from the 'G.cells.volumes' value
%       computed by the 'computeGeometry' function.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   computeGeometry.
