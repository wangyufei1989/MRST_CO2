function [cellNo, cellFaces, isNNC] = getCellNoFaces(G)
%Get a list over all half faces, accounting for possible NNC
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [cellNo, cellFaces, isNNC] = getCellNoFaces(G)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This utility function is used to produce a listing of all half faces
%   in a grid along with the respective cells they belong to. While
%   relatively trivial for most grids, this function specifically accounts
%   for non-neighboring connections / NNC.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   G         - Grid structure with optional .nnc.cells field.
%
% RETURNS:
%   cellNo    - A list of length number of geometric half-faces + 2* no. nnc
%             connections where each entry corresponds to the cell index of
%             that half face.
%
%   cellFaces - A list of length number of geometric half-faces + 2* number
%             of nnc connections where each entry is the connection index.
%             For the first entries, this is simply the face number.
%             Otherwise, it is the entry of the NNC connection.
%
%   isNNC     - A list with the same length as cellNo / cellFaces,
%               containing a boolean indicating if that specific connection
%               originates from a geometric face or a NNC connection
