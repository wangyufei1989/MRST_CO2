function cellno = gridCellNo(G, varargin)
%Construct map from half-faces to cells or cell subset
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   cellno = gridCellNo(G)
%   cellno = gridCellNo(G, c)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G - Grid structure.
%
%   c - Cells for which to construct mapping.  Array of numeric cell
%       indices in the range 1:G.cells.num .
%
%       OPTIONAL.  If unspecified, function 'gridCellNo' will behave as if
%
%           c = 1 : G.cells.num
%
%       In other words the map will be constructed for all grid cells.
%
% RETURNS:
%   cellno -
%       Map from half-faces to cell or cell subset indices.  The expression
%
%           c(cellno(hf))
%
%       derives the cell in 'G' to which half-face 'hf' belongs.  This, in
%       turn, means that if 'c' is unspecified, then 'cellno(hf)' is that
%       cell directly.  The half-face 'hf' must be relative to the cell
%       subset identified by 'c' or global if 'c' is not specified.
