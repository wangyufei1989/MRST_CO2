function v = indirectionSub(i, valuePos, values)
% Index map of the type G.cells.facePos, G.faces.nodePos...
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   v = indirectionSub(i, valuePos, values)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   i           - Indices where we want values, for instance a list of
%                 cells if valuePos is G.cells.facePos.
%
%   valuePos    - Mapping from i to values.
%
%   values      - The actual values
%
%
% RETURNS:
%   v           - The set of values corresonding to i.
