function A = getConnectivityMatrix(N, varargin)
%Derive global, undirected connectivity matrix from neighbourship relation.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   A = getConnectivityMatrix(N)
%   A = getConnectivityMatrix(N, incDiag)
%   A = getConnectivityMatrix(N, incDiag, nRows)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   N       - Neighbourship relation as defined by function
%             'getNeighbourship'.  Must consist entirely of internal
%             connections (i.e., no boundary connections must be included).
%
%   incDiag - Flag to indicate whether or not to include the "self"
%             connections (i.e., the diagonal entries) in the connectivity
%             matrix.  LOGICAL.  Default value: incDiag = FALSE (don't
%             include "self" connections, in which case the resulting
%             matrix is the same as the graph's adjacency matrix).
%
%   nRows   - Size (number of rows) of the resulting connectivity matrix.
%             Used to create the diagonal entries of the connectivity
%             matrix when 'incDiag' is TRUE.  Scalar integer.  Default
%             value: nRows = -1 (determine matrix size from maximum index
%             in the neighbourship relation, 'N').
%
% RETURNS:
%   A - Undirected connectivity matrix that represents all cell's
%       neighbourship relations (edges).
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   % Compute and plot the connectivity ("graph") matrix resulting from the
%   % (internal) geometrical connections in a Cartesian grid.  Include the
%   % diagonal entries of the connectivity matrix.
%   %
%   [incBdry, incDiag] = deal(false, true);
%   G = cartGrid([60, 220, 85]);
%   N = getNeighbourship(G, 'Geometrical', incBdry);
%   A = getConnectivityMatrix(N, incDiag, G.cells.num);
%   spy(A)
%
