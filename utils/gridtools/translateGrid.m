function G = translateGrid(G, dx)
%Move all grid coordinates according to particular translation
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   G = translateGrid(G, dx)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G  - MRST grid as outlined in 'grid_structure'.
%
%   dx - User-specified constant translation vector.  Must be a single
%        vector that will applied to all grid coordinates (i.e., nodes and
%        centroids).  Number of vector components must be equal to the
%        number of vertex coordinates (i.e., SIZE(G.nodes.coords, 2)).
%
% RETURNS:
%   G - Updated grid structure.
