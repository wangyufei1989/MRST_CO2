function c = findEnclosingCell(G, pt)
%Find cells with closest centroid (in Euclidian norm) in a 2D grid.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   c = findEnclosingCell(G, pt)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G  - Valid grid structure.  Must represent a two-dimensional geometry.
%
%   pt - Set of point coordinates, represented as an n-by-2 DOUBLE array.
%
% RETURNS:
%   c  - Set of grid cells.  Specifically, c(i) for i=1:n, is the global
%        grid cell from 'G' for which
%
%           sum(bsxfun(@minus, G.cells.centroids, pt(i,:)) .^ 2, 2)
%
%        is minimised. If a point lies on the boundary between two cells,
%        the function returns the smallest index.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   pebi.
