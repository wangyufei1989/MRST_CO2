function [N, varargout] = getNeighbourship(G, varargin)
%Retrieve neighbourship relation ("graph") from grid
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%    N         = getNeighbourship(G)
%    N         = getNeighbourship(G, kind)
%    N         = getNeighbourship(G, kind, incBdry)
%   [N, isnnc] = getNeighbourship(...)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G       - MRST grid as defined by 'grid_structure'.
%
%   kind    - What kind of neighbourship relation to extract.  String.  The
%             following options are supported:
%               - 'Geometrical' --
%                    Extract geometrical neighbourship relations.  The
%                    geometric connections correspond to physical,
%                    geometric interfaces and are the ones listed in
%                    'G.faces.neighbors'.
%
%               - 'Topological' --
%                    Extract topological neighbourship relations.  In
%                    addition to the geometrical relations of 'Geometrical'
%                    these possibly include non-neighbouring connections
%                    resulting from pinch-out processing or explicit NNC
%                    lists in an ECLIPSE input deck.
%
%                    Additional connections will only be defined if the
%                    grid 'G' contains an 'nnc' sub-structure.
%
%   incBdry - Flag to indicate whether or not to include boundary
%             connections.  A boundary connection is a connection in which
%             one of the connecting cells is the outside (i.e., cell zero).
%             LOGICAL scalar.  Default value: incBdry = FALSE (do NOT
%             include boundary connections).
%
% RETURNS:
%   N     - Neighbourship relation.  An m-by-2 array of cell indices that
%           form the connections, geometrical or otherwise.  This array has
%           similar interpretation to the field 'G.faces.neighbors', but
%           may contain additional connections if kind='Topological'.
%
%   isnnc - An m-by-1 LOGICAL array indicating whether or not the
%           corresponding connection (row) of N is a geometrical connection
%           (i.e., a geometric interface from the grid 'G').
%
%           Specifically, isnnc(i) is TRUE if N(i,:) comes from a
%           non-neighbouring (i.e., non-geometrical) connection.
%
% NOTE:
%   If the neighbourship relation is later to be used to compute the graph
%   adjacency matrix using function 'getConnectivityMatrix', then 'incBdry'
%   must be FALSE.

%   processGRDECL, processPINCH, getConnectivityMatrix.
