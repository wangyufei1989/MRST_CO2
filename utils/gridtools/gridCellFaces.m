function [cf, p] = gridCellFaces(G, c)
% Find faces corresponding to a set of cells
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [cf, p] = gridCellFaces(G, c)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G    - Grid structure
%   c    - Cells where the fine faces are desired
%
%
% RETURNS:
%   p    - indirectionmap into n. The faces of cell c(i) is found at
%   positions p(i):p(i+1)-1 in n
%   cf    - cell face positions in G
