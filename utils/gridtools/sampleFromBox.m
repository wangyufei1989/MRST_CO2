function q = sampleFromBox(G, p, c)
%Sample from data on a uniform Cartesian grid that covers the bounding box
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%    q = sampleFromBox(G, p)
%    q = sampleFromBox(G, p, c)
%
%
% PARAMETERS:
%    G  - grid structure
%    p  - input array to sample from. The array is assumed to be values
%         on a uniform Cartesian grid covers the bounding box of grid G.
%         The values should be given as a Nx by Ny matrix where Nx and Ny
%         is the number of values in the x and y direction respectively.
%    c  - array specifying a subset of cells in G in which values will be
%         sampled
%
% RETURNS:
%    q  - output vector sampled at the centroids of grid cells in G
