function N = neighboursByNodes(G, varargin)
%Derive neighbourship from common node (vertex) relationship
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   N = neighboursByNodes(G)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G - Grid structure.
%
% RETURNS:
%   N - A neighbourship relation (m-by-2 array of inter-cell connections
%       (i.e., cell pairs)).  Two cells are defined to be neighbours (and
%       entered into the neighbourship relation) if they share a common
%       node.  The neighbourship relation is not symmetric and does not
%       include self-connections.
%
%       Use the statement
%
%          Adj = getConnectivityMatrix(N, true, G.cells.num)
%
%       to convert the neighbourship relation 'N' into an undirected
%       adjacency matrix (neighbourhood), 'Adj'.
%
% NOTE:
%   This function uses SORTROWS and is potentially *very* expensive in
%   terms of memory use.  As an example, the statement
%
%      N = neighboursByNodes(cartGrid([60, 220, 85]))
%
%   requires about 6.5 GB of RAM and takes in the order of 20 seconds on a
%   workstation from the autumn of 2009.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   getConnectivityMatrix, sortrows.
