function [n, pos] = gridFaceNodes(G, f)
% Find nodes corresponding to a set of faces
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [n, pos] = gridFaceNodes(G, c)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G    - Grid structure
%   c    - Cells where the fine nodes are desired
%
%
% RETURNS:
%   pos  - indirectionmap into n. The nodes of face f(i) is found at
%   positions p(i):p(i+1)-1 in n
%   n    - node positions in G
