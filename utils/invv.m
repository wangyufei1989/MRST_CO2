function varargout = invv(varargin)
%Compute inverse of sequence of square matrices using LAPACK.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   B = invv(A, sz)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   A  - Array (type DOUBLE) containing the elements/entries of a sequence
%        of square matrices--ordered consequtively.  Each matrix is
%        expected to be small (dimension less than 50).
%
%   sz - Sequence of matrix block sizes.  The number of matrix blocks
%        contained in 'A' is implicitly assumed to be NUMEL(sz).
%
% RETURNS:
%   B  - Array (type DOUBLE) containing the elements/entries of the
%        sequence of inverses of the square matrices contained in 'A' and
%        whose block sizes are 'sz'.
%
% NOTE:
%   The output is algorithmically equivalent to the loop
%
%       p = cumsum([1, sz.^2]);
%       B = zeros([p(end) - 1, 1]);
%       for i = 1 : numel(sz),
%          ix    = p(i) : p(i + 1) - 1;
%          B(ix) = inv(reshape(A(ix), sz([i, i])));
%       end
%
%   except for round-off errors.
