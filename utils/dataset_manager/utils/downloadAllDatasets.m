function downloadAllDatasets(askFirst)
%Download all datasets known to MRST and available for direct download
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   
%   askFirst - (OPTIONAL) Boolean indicating if the user should be prompted
%              before starting the download. Default on. 
%
% RETURNS:
%   Nothing. Prints output to command line.
%
% NOTE:
%   Avoid using this function in scripts. Rather, opt for the more

%   to download.
