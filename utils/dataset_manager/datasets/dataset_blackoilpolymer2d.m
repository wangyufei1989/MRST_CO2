The schedule contains first a period of water injection without polymer, then a water flooding period with polymer, followed by a pure water flooding phase without polymer. Two data files are included, the only difference is that one considers shear effects for polymer injection, while the other one not. The reference results from Eclipse are also included for the two cases.', ...
