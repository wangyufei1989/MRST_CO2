function d = darcy()
%Compute numerical value, in units of m^2, of the Darcy constant.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   d = darcy()
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   None.
%
% RETURNS:
%   d - Numerical value, in units of m^2, of the Darcy constant.
%
% NOTE:
%   A porous medium with a permeability of 1 darcy permits a flow (flux) of
%   1 cm³/s of a fluid with viscosity 1 cP (1 mPa·s) under a pressure
%   gradient of 1 atm/cm acting across an area of 1 cm².
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   gravity.
