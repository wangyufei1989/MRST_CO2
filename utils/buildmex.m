function buildmex(varargin)
%Wrapper around MEX which abstracts away details of pathname generation.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   buildmex [options ...] file [files ...]
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   BUILDMEX accepts the same file and option parameters as MEX, with the
%   additional provision that filenames which do not start with FILESEP are
%   interpreted as pathnames relative to the directory containing the M
%   file which calls BUILDMEX.  Absolute pathnames (those starting with
%   FILESEP) are left untouched.
%
%   Note: All parameters must be character strings.
%   Note: Function BUILDMEX requests -largeArrayDims from MEX.
%
% RETURNS:
%   Nothing, but a compiled mex-function with the same name as the caller
%   is produced in the directory containing the M file which calls BUILDMEX.
%
% CAVEAT:
%   Function BUILDMEX must be called from an M file only; it cannot be
%   invoked from the base workspace.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   filesep, mex.
