function varargout = multiEig(varargin)
%Solve sequence of general (unsymmetric) eigenvalue problems using LAPACK
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%    d        = multiEig(A, sz)
%   [d, v]    = multiEig(A, sz)
%   [d, v, w] = multiEig(A, sz)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   A  - Array (type DOUBLE) containing the elements/entries of a sequence
%        of coefficient matrices--ordered consequtively.  Each matrix is
%        expected to be square and fairly small.
%
%   sz - Sequence of matrix block sizes.  The number of matrix blocks
%        contained in 'A' is implicitly assumed to be NUMEL(rsz).
%
% RETURNS:
%   d - Array (type DOUBLE, possibly complex) containing the eigenvalues of
%       the individual eigenvalue problems.
%
%   v - Array (type DOUBLE) of right eigenvectors.  Optional.  Only returned
%       if requested.
%
%   w - Array (type DOUBLE) of left eigenvectors.  Optional.  Only returned
%       if requested.
%
% NOTE:
%   The output in the single return value case is algorithmically equivalent
%   to the loop
%
%       pA = cumsum([1, sz .^ 2]);
%       pd = cumsum([1, sz]);
%       d  = zeros([pd(end) - 1, 1]);
%
%       for i = 1 : numel(sz),
%          iA = pA(i) : pA(i + 1) - 1;
%          id = pd(i) : pd(i + 1) - 1;
%
%          d(id) = eig(reshape(A(iA), [sz(i), sz(i)]), 'vector');
%       end
%
%   except for round-off errors.  Rank deficient matrices are supported.
