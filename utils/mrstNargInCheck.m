function mrstNargInCheck(low, high, nargIn)
%Check number of input arguments to function
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   mrstNargInCheck(low, high, nargIn)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Fails execution (calls ERROR) unless actual number of input arguments
%   to calling function is between lower and upper limits inclusive.  This
%   function should usually not be called within a loop as it is
%   implemented in terms of DBSTACK.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   low    - Minumum number of input arguments needed by calling function.
%            If empty (i.e., if ISEMPTY(low)), this limit is not checked.
%
%   high   - Maximum number of input arguments allowed by calling function.
%            If empty (i.e., if ISEMPTY(high)), this limit is not checked.
%
%   nargIn - Actual number of input arguments.  Must be scalar, integral
%            and non-negative.  Should be NARGIN unless there are special
%            circumstances.
