function faceFlux = cellFlux2faceFlux(G, cellFlux)
%Transform cell-based flux field to face-based.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   faceFlux = cellFlux2faceFlux(G, cellFlux)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G        - grid structure
%
%   cellFlux - Set of flux vectors in cell-wise ordering.  One column for
%              each flux vector.
%
% RETURNS:
%   faceFlux - Set of face-wise ordered fluxes.  One column for each of the
%              input flux vectors.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   faceFlux2cellFlux.
