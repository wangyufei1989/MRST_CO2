function dyidx = dinterpq1(x, y, xi)
%Compute derivative of piecewise linear interpolant.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   dyi = dintrpq1(x, y, xi)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   x   - Vector of length at least two containing coordinates of
%         underlying interval.  The values must either be monotonically
%         increasing or monotonically decreasing.
%
%   y   - Function values of piecewise linear function at points x.  Must
%         be a vector containing NUMEL(x) elements.
%
%   xi  - Points at which to compute derivative values of function y(x).
%
% RETURNS:
%   dyi - Column vector containing derivative values of function y(x).
%         One scalar value for each point in the input vector 'xi'.
%
% NOTE:
%   Function dinterpq1 assumes that all input arrays contain only finite
%   values.  That is, we assume that
%
%       ~(any(isinf(x)) || any(isinf(y)) || any(isinf(xi)))
%
%   Furthermore dinterpq1 employs linear extrapolation outside the data
%   points (x,y).
%
% EXAMPLES:
%   % Compute derivatives at xi=[-10, 0.1, pi, 100] of a piecewise linear
%   % function whose piecewise derivative values are 1:10.
%   x = 0 : 10; y = cumsum(x);
%   dinterpq1(x, y, [-10, 0.1, pi, 100])
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   interp1q.

   % for the data.
