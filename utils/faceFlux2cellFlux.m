function cellFlux = faceFlux2cellFlux(G, faceFlux)
%Transform face-based flux field to cell-based.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   cellFlux = faceFlux2cellFlux(G, faceFlux);
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G        - Grid structure.
%
%   faceFlux - Set of face-wise ordered fluxes.  One column for each flux
%              vector.
%
% RETURNS:
%   cellFlux - Set of flux vectors in cell-wise ordering.  One column for
%              each of the input flux vectors.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   cellFlux2faceFlux.
