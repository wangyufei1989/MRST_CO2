function src = addSource(src, c, r, varargin)
%Add an explicit source to (new or existing) source object.
%
% There can only be a single net source term per cell in the grid.  This
% is now enforced.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   src = addSource(src, cells, values)
%   src = addSource(src, cells, values, 'pn1', pv1)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   src    - Source structure from a prior call to 'addSource' which will
%            be updated on output or an empty array (src==[]) in which case
%            a new source structure is created.
%
%   cells  - Indices in external model for which this source should be
%            applied.
%
%   values - Strength of source.  One scalar value for each cell in
%            'cells'.  Note that the values in 'values' are interpreted as
%            flux rates (typically in units of m^3/Day) rather than as flux
%            density rates (which must be integrated over the cell volumes
%            in order to obtain flux rates).  Specifically, the mimetic
%            pressure solvers do not integrate these values.
%
%            In the special case that a single value is provided, it will
%            be assumed valid for all cells in the input.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS (supplied in 'key'/value pairs ('pn'/pv ...)):
%   sat    - Fluid composition of injected fluid in injection cells.
%            An n-by-m array of fluid compositions with 'n' being the
%            number of cells in 'cells' and 'm' the number of components in
%            the saturation. For m=3, the columns interpreted as
%              1 <-> Aqua, 2 <-> Liquid, 3 <-> Vapor.
%
%            This field is for the benefit of transport solvers such as
%            'blackoilUpwFE' and will be ignored for production source
%            cells (i.e. when values < 0).
%
%            Default value: sat = [] (assume single-phase flow).
%
%            As a special case, if SIZE(sat,1)==1, then the saturation
%            value will be repeated for all affected cells defined by the
%            'cells' parameter.
%
% RETURNS:
%   src - New or updated source structure having the following fields:
%           - cell -- Cells for which explicit sources are provided
%           - rate -- Rates or values of these explicit sources
%           - sat  -- Fluid composition of injected fluids in injection
%                     cells.

%   See simpleSRCandBC.m
