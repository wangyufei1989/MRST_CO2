function bc = addBC(bc, f, t, v, f_hv,fhv,varargin)
%Add boundary condition to (new or existing) BC object
%
% There can only be a single boundary condition per face in the grid.  This
% is now enforced. Solvers assume boundary conditions are given on the
% boundary;  conditions in the interior of the domain yield unpredictable
% results.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   bc = addBC(bc, faces, type, values)
%   bc = addBC(bc, faces, type, values, 'pn1', pv1, ...)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   bc     - Boundary condition structure from a prior call to 'addBC'
%            which will be updated on output or an empty array (bc==[]) in
%            which case a new boundary condition structure is created.
%
%   faces  - Global faces in external model for which this boundary
%            condition should be applied.
%
%   type   - Type of boundary condition.  Supported values are 'pressure'
%            and 'flux', or cell array of such strings.
%
%   values - Boundary condition value.  Interpreted as a pressure value (in
%            units of 'Pa') when type=='pressure' and as a flux value (in
%            units of 'm^3/s') when type=='flux'.  One scalar value for
%            each face in 'faces'.
%
%            Note: If type=='flux', the values in 'values' are interpreted
%            as injection fluxes (into the reservoir).  Specifically, a
%            positive value is interpreted as an injection flux.  To
%            specify an extraction flux (i.e., flux out of the reservoir),
%            the caller should provide a negative value in 'values'.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS (supplied in 'key'/value pairs ('pn'/pv ...)):
%   sat    - Fluid composition of fluid injected across inflow faces.
%            An n-by-m array of fluid compositions with 'n' being the
%            number of faces in 'faces' and for m=3, the columns
%            interpreted as 1 <-> Aqua, 2 <-> Liquid, 3 <-> Vapor.
%
%            This field is for the benefit of transport solvers such as
%            'blackoilUpwFE' and will be ignored for outflow faces.
%
%            Default value: sat = [] (assume single-phase flow).
%
% NOTE
%   For convenience, values and sat may contain a single value.  This value
%   is then used for all faces specified in the call.
%
% RETURNS:
%   bc - New or updated boundary condition structure having the following
%        fields:
%           - face  -- External faces for which explicit BCs are provided.
%           - type  -- Cell array of strings denoting type of BC.
%           - value -- Boundary condition values for all faces in 'face'.
%           - sat   -- Fluid composition of fluids passing through inflow
%                      faces.
