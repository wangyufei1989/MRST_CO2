function bc = fluxside(bc, G, side, flux, varargin)
%Impose flux boundary condition on global side.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   bc = fluxside(bc, G, side, flux)
%   bc = fluxside(bc, G, side, flux, 'pn', pv)
%   bc = fluxside(bc, G, side, flux, I1, I2)
%   bc = fluxside(bc, G, side, flux, I1, I2, 'pn', pv)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   bc     - boundary condition structure as defined by function 'addBC'.
%
%   G      - Grid structure as described by grid_structure.  Currently
%            restricted to grids produced by functions cartGrid and
%            tensorGrid.
%
%   side   - Global side from which to extract face indices.  String.  Must
%            (case insensitively) match one of six alias groups:
%
%               1) {'West' , 'XMin', 'Left'  }
%               2) {'East' , 'XMax', 'Right' }
%               3) {'South', 'YMin', 'Back'  }
%               4) {'North', 'YMax', 'Front' }
%               5) {'Upper', 'ZMin', 'Top'   }
%               6) {'Lower', 'ZMax', 'Bottom'}
%
%            These groups correspond to the cardinal directions mentioned
%            as the first alternative in each group.
%
%   flux   - Total flux, in units of m^3/s, (scalar) accounted for by
%            faces on side in ranges I1 and I2.
%
%            Note: The 'flux' value is interpreted by the pressure and
%            transport solvers as an injection flux (into the reservoir).
%            Specifically, a positive value is interpreted as an injection
%            flux.  To specify an extraction flux (i.e., flux out of the
%            reservoir), the caller should provide a negative value in
%            'flux'.
%
%   I1, I2 - Cell index ranges for local (in-plane) axes one and two,
%            respectively.  An empty index range ([]) is interpreted as
%            covering the entire corresponding local axis of 'side' in the
%            grid 'G'.  The local axes on a 'side' in 'G' are ordered
%            according to 'X' before 'Y', and 'Y' before 'Z'.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS (supplied in 'key'/value pairs ('pn'/pv ...)):
%   sat    - Fluid composition of fluid injected across inflow faces.
%            An n-by-m array of fluid compositions with 'n' being the
%            number of individual faces specified by (I1,I2) (i.e.,
%            n==NUMEL(I1)*NUMEL(I2)) or one.  If m=3, the columns of 'sat'
%            are interpreted as 1 <-> Aqua, 2 <-> Liquid, 3 <-> Vapor.
%
%            This field is for the benefit of transport solvers such as
%            'blackoilUpwFE' and will be ignored for outflow faces.
%
%            Default value: sat = [] (assume single-phase flow).
%
%   range  - Restricts the search for outer faces to a subset of the cells
%            in the direction perpendicular to that of the face. Example:
%            if side='LEFT', one will only search for outer faces in the
%            cells with logical indexes [range,:,:].
%            Default value: range = [] (do not restrict search).
%
% RETURNS:
%   bc     - Updated boundary condition structure.
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   See simpleBC.
